# GraphUtil

Adds more settings to the F3 FPS graph to make it more useful for finding performance issues.

## Features

- Show min/max/avg frametimes with decimalpoints.
- Optionally scale the graph to the min/max size, so it's still readable in the <5ms range.
- Show a line for the avg times.
- Option to always show graphs on the debug screen without ALT+SHIFT+F3.
