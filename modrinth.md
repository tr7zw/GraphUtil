Adds more settings to the F3 graphs to make them more helpful in finding performance issues.

## Features

- Show min/max/avg frame times with decimal points.
- Optionally scale the graph to the min/max size, so it's still readable in the <5ms range.
- Show a line for the avg times.
- Option to always show graphs on the debug screen without ALT+SHIFT+F3.
- Hide the TPS graph.
- Limit the graph to its box(no more red lines filling the screen)
